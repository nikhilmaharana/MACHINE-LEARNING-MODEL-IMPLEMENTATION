## The Spam Email Detection project is a practical machine learning application that focuses on classifying email or SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam) using natural language processing and classification techniques. In this project, we have used the well-known SMS Spam Collection dataset, which consists of thousands of labeled messages that serve as training and testing data for building a predictive model. The goal is to accurately detect spam messages to help users avoid unnecessary or potentially harmful communications. The dataset was loaded directly from a publicly available source, and it contains two columns: one for the label (ham/spam) and another for the message text. To prepare the data, the text was first cleaned and preprocessed, and the labels were converted into numerical values using simple mapping: 0 for ham and 1 for spam. The messages were then split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance reliably. Since machine learning algorithms cannot process raw text, the TfidfVectorizer from Scikit-learn was used to convert textual data into numerical feature vectors based on term frequency-inverse document frequency, which helps highlight important words while reducing the effect of commonly used stopwords. After transforming the data, the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm was chosen as the classification model due to its efficiency and effectiveness in text classification problems. The model was trained on the training data and then evaluated using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. The final model achieved high accuracy, demonstrating its capability to distinguish between spam and ham messages. A heatmap was generated from the confusion matrix using Seaborn to visualize true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, making it easier to interpret the results. Additionally, a custom input example was tested to check how the model responds to real-time data, further proving the modelâ€™s usefulness. Throughout the project, Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn played a central role in managing data, performing preprocessing, building the model, and evaluating the results. This project not only provides a strong foundation in text classification using machine learning but also introduces students and beginners to key concepts in natural language processing. Moreover, the simplicity of using Scikit-learn makes this project reproducible and expandable, meaning more complex models or larger datasets can be plugged in to enhance performance. This spam detection system can be further extended into real-world applications like email filtering, SMS protection, or integrated into customer service systems to block phishing or fraudulent messages. The strength of this project lies in its clean implementation and the use of a standard machine learning pipeline: data acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, prediction, and evaluation. By completing this task, I have learned how to translate a real-world problem into a machine learning solution and evaluate it effectively. The knowledge gained from this internship task has reinforced my understanding of supervised learning, especially in text-based classification, and has improved my skills in building deployable models for NLP use-cases. This project not only fulfills the requirements of the CodTech Internship Task-4 but also contributes significantly to my journey in the machine learning and AI field.
